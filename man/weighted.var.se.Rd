\title{Weighted Variance - Standard Error}
\usage{
weighted.var.se(x, w = NULL, xLoc = 2, wLoc = 3, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector. Alternatively, x can be a matrix-like object that
includes data for the vector and the weights.}

\item{w}{a numeric vector of weights.}

\item{xLoc}{if x is matrix-like, this specifies the column containing vector
information. Can be the column number or name.}

\item{wLoc}{if x is matrix-like, this specifies the column containing weight
information. Can be the column number or name.}

\item{na.rm}{if True, remove NA's from data. Default is False}
}
\description{
Returns the weighted standard error of a vector. A numeric vector and its weights
must be provided.
